                <br>
                <p>I am a full-time 2nd-year student at Concordia University studying electrical engineering. Besides studying, 
                    I'm also involved in volunteering work; I'm also a VP member with Women in STEM at Concordia, a board member 
                    in ITREB (Ismaili Tariqa Religious Education Board), and do regular volunteering in events. Also, 
                    I've been involved for few years in the past in the fundraising called 
                    <a href = "https://www.worldpartnershipwalk.com/fr/">World Partnership Walk</a>, where I had to process the money 
                    collected from others in the system, and bring awareness to others about the walk and fundraising.
